**ABSTRACT**
With the increasing prevalence of online threats, the detection of phishing websites has become a critical component of cyber security. This study proposes a novel approach for identifying phishing websites by leveraging a comprehensive set of features extracted from various aspects of website content and behavior. The methodology involves the extraction and analysis of features such as URL structure, HTML and JavaScript content, SSL certificate details, and website traffic patterns. The research employs machine learning techniques to build a robust model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and phishing websites based on the extracted features. Feature selection methods are applied to identify the most discriminative attributes, optimizing the model's efficiency and performance. The dataset used for training and evaluation comprises a diverse collection of both legitimate and confirmed phishing websites, ensuring the model's ability to generalize across different attack scenarios.
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature-based approach in accurately detecting phishing websites. Comparative analyses with existing detection methods showcase the superiority of the proposed model in terms of precision, recall, and overall accuracy. Furthermore, the model exhibits resilience to evasion techniques commonly employed by cybercriminals, contributing to its reliability in real-world scenarios. The findings of this research offer valuable insights into the importance of feature-based analysis for phishing website detection. The proposed methodology presents a promising solution for enhancing the security of online users by providing an advanced and adaptive defense against evolving phishing threats. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the feature-based approach outlined in this study lays the foundation for proactive and effective countermeasures against phishing attacks.
